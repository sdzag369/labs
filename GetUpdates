-------------------------
Getting updates from forked repo
git remote add upstream  https://github.com/lerndevops/labs.git( repo name from where your forked)

git fetch upstream

git checkout master (just to make sure that you are at your master branch)

Either.
(If no updates you made to your repo yet and just need to get updates from upstream/original repo)
git rebase upstream/master

Or
(If you have made changes to your local copy and also need to get updates from upstream/orginal repo)
git merge upstream/master.

Git push (will push your local changes to your github thus your forked branch and original branch will be in sync)
